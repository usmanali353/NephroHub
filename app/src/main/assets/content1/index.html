<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>Keep
Your Kidneys Healthy</B></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Do you ever
contemplate your kidneys? Join the club if you answered &ldquo;no.&rdquo;
After all, why would you pay them any attention if they don&rsquo;t
cause you any problems? Whether you think about them or not, each
day, these important organs filter 200 liters of blood, sifting out
about 2 liters of waste and water that your body excretes as urine.
&ldquo;Kidneys usually work in the background,&rdquo; says Jacquelyn
Wilson, MD, a homeopathic doctor in San Diego. Called the
&ldquo;biochemists of the body,&rdquo; these bean-shaped organs are
about the size of your fist and sit on either side of your spine at
the small of your back. Each one contains about 1.5 million filters
that balance the electrolytes (sodium, phosphorous, and others) in
your blood, regulate the amount of fluid in your system, and clean
out waste&mdash;by-products from your muscles, acids from foods
you&rsquo;ve eaten, and leftover chemicals that your body produces as
you burn fat. As if all this weren&rsquo;t enough, your kidneys are
also little hormone factories that affect the health of your blood,
bones, and heart, releasing the following:</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>Erythropoietin
(EPO). </B>When kidney cells sense that the body&rsquo;s oxygen
levels are low, they release more EPO, which stimulates the bone
marrow to make more red blood cells to help carry more oxygen to the
entire body. So if the kidneys don&rsquo;t work properly, your body
doesn&rsquo;t get enough oxygen. The result? Anemia.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Calcitriol.
Your bones need the kidneys to produce enough of this active form of
vitamin D (actually a hormone) so that they maintain proper calcium
levels.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Renin. Not
a hormone per se, but an enzyme that eventually produces the hormone
angiotensin II. This hormone, in a roundabout way, causes the kidneys
to retain more water and salt, increasing blood pressure when it
drops too low.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">The most
important thing to remember about your kidneys is that they exist to
maintain homeostasis&mdash;fluid balance&mdash;in the body. For
example, if your blood pressure increases, the kidneys kick into gear
to excrete more water and salts so that the volume of blood goes down
and your blood pressure decreases. If your blood pressure gets too
low, the kidneys decrease the amount of water and salts they excrete
so blood volume goes up and blood pressure increases.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>When
good kidneys go bad</B></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Unfortunately,
most people don&rsquo;t learn about kidney problems until it&rsquo;s
too late, because most kidney diseases don&rsquo;t produce any
symptoms, says Leslie Spry, MD, of the National Kidney Foundation.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD)&mdash;abnormalities in kidney or urine
function for three months or more&mdash;has become more prevalent in
the past 10 years. The rise in CKD, now the ninth leading cause of
death in the US, may correlate with the national increases in
diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity. Why? Because diabetes
prevents glucose from breaking down, and the excess glucose can
damage the nephrons, the part of the kidney responsible for purifying
and filtering blood. Chronic high blood pressure can damage blood
vessels throughout the body, including in the kidneys, making it more
difficult for the kidneys to remove waste and fluids.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Researchers
aren&rsquo;t quite sure why obesity plays a role, but a 2006 study
published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that even people
who are moderately overweight are seven times more likely to have
kidney failure than their thinner counterparts. The research suggests
that obese people are more likely to get diabetes or suffer from high
blood pressure, but even more than that, &ldquo;Obesity places more
metabolic demand on the kidneys, forcing them to work harder,&rdquo;
says Chi-yuan Hsu, MD, assistant professor of medicine at the
University of California, San Francisco and lead author of the study.
Other reasons for kidney failure include autoimmune disease, taking
NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) for several years, and
inflammation.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Generally
speaking, kidney failure happens gradually, over many years&mdash;unless,
of course, you&rsquo;ve been poisoned or have had a physical injury
to the kidney area. If your kidneys are failing, symptoms may include
fever or chills, swelling of your ankles, puffy eyes, fatigue, weight
loss, dark urine, abdominal pain, itching, or pale skin. But most of
the time you won&rsquo;t experience anything at all. In fact, says
Kelly Welsh, a Milwaukee-based dietician specializing in kidney
health, &ldquo;symptoms don&rsquo;t appear until 60 to 70 percent of
kidney function is lost.&rdquo;</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>What you
can do now</B></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">While you
can&rsquo;t prevent your kidneys from aging (like everything else),
you can slow down the process. Of course, the healthier you are in
your younger years, the healthier your kidneys will be when you&rsquo;re
old and gray. Here are the Ten Commandments of good kidney health to
incorporate into your lifestyle today.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>1. Stop
smoking.</B> The results of a 2007 study published by the American
Physiological Society suggest that nicotine is a major factor in the
development of kidney disease.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>2. Get
your &ldquo;levels&rdquo; under control:</B> cholesterol, blood
pressure, and blood sugar.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>3.
Rethink your diet.</B> Avoid soda (especially ones with high-fructose
corn syrup, a known cause of obesity and inflammation); load up on
organic fruits, veggies, and whole grains; stay away from salty and
processed foods; and limit animal products to lean cuts of chicken or
fish a couple of times a week.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">4.
Pay attention to your digestion.</SPAN> Adding pre- and probiotics
and additional fiber can aid elimination; steering clear of
pesticide-laden foods will put less strain on your kidneys.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>5. Avoid
pain medications </B>and any other prescription or over-the-counter
meds that may tax the kidneys, such as Motrin, Advil, and any other
NSAIDs. If you have to use them, even short term, take milk thistle
(80 to 160 mg two to three times a day).</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>6. Get
plenty of exercise, </B>including aerobics that will get your heart
rate up, five or six times a week.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>7. Stay
hydrated.</B> Drink at least six to eight glasses of water
(preferably filtered) every day.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>8. Cut
back on alcohol consumption. </B>Overindulgence can increase blood
pressure (a problem for the kidneys) and urination (which can cause
dehydration).</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>9. Do
something every day to decompress and de-stress,</B> such as
listening to music, doing yoga or t&rsquo;ai chi, or laughing with
friends and family.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>10. Take
these herbs</B> to keep your kidneys healthy and prevent kidney
stones and other problems:</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>Dandelion:</B>
Rich in beta-carotene and high in potassium, dandelion works as a
gentle diuretic, as well as a liver and kidney tonic. The roots can
be steeped as a tea, and the leaves eaten raw in salads. Or take 500
mg twice a day.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>Stinging
nettle: </B>Taken in tea (1 tablespoon steeped in 1 cup of hot water)
or supplement form (follow dosing on the package), nettles are high
in chlorophyll, which tones and supports the whole body, particularly
the urinary and digestive systems.</SPAN></FONT></P>
