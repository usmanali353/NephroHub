to Protect Your Kidneys From RA</B></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Keeping
your rheumatoid arthritis under control with the right treatment and
a healthy lifestyle could help protect your kidneys. </SPAN></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Taking
steps to protect your kidneys is especially important when you have
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Rheumatoid arthritis makes you more likely
to develop chronic kidney disease, which can increase the risk of
complications from both conditions, like heart disease. Simple steps
can help you reduce this health risk and keep your kidneys healthy. </SPAN></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>The
Connection Between Kidney Disease and RA</B></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">A
growing number of studies show that kidney disease is more common
among people with rheumatoid arthritis than in the general public.
For example, one in four people with rheumatoid arthritis develops
chronic kidney disease, compared with one in five people in the
general population, according to a study published in 2014 in the
American Journal of Kidney Diseases. </SPAN></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Researchers
also found that heart disease was more common among people with RA
and kidney disease. People with rheumatoid arthritis already face a
higher risk of heart disease and atherosclerosis (hardening of the
arteries) that, in turn, can eventually impair kidney function. </SPAN></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Kidney
disease is a known risk factor for heart disease, yet the link
between kidney disease and RA isn&rsquo;t fully understood. The
conditions may occur independently, or the two diseases may share a
common autoimmune or inflammatory connection within the body. </SPAN></FONT>

High Blood Pressure Often Untreated With RA</B></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">In
most cases, kidney damage is a result of poorly controlled rheumatoid
arthritis or the drugs used to treat it. &ldquo;The relationship is
usually not direct,&rdquo; said Carmen Gota, MD, a rheumatologist at
the Cleveland Clinic. She added that kidney disease among people with
RA is usually a side effect of long-term use of rheumatoid arthritis
drugs like corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, and celecoxib. These
drugs can indirectly cause kidney damage by raising blood pressure
levels and putting additional stress on the kidneys. Other rheumatoid
arthritis drugs, such as methotrexate, can be toxic to the kidneys at
high doses and are not recommend for people with existing kidney
damage and RA.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>How
to Keep Your Kidneys Healthy With RA</B></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
first step to maintaining your kidney health with rheumatoid
arthritis is to get your RA diagnosed and treated early with the
right drugs rather than just relying on NSAIDs to manage symptoms,
Dr. Gota said. That's because anti-inflammatory drugs don't slow the
course of the disease like disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs
(DMARDs), which are not linked to kidney damage.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Second,
Gota said, early treatment of rheumatoid arthritis will help prevent
cardiovascular disease and limit the chronic inflammation that leads
to atherosclerosis and kidney damage. </SPAN></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Other
helpful tips for maintaining kidney health with RA include:</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&bull;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Exercise
regularly to keep the kidneys and other organs functioning normally.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&bull;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Eat
a heart-healthy, low-fat diet rich in fruits and vegetables.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&bull;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Limit
your salt intake, which can raise blood pressure and cause kidney
damage.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&bull;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Keep
cholesterol levels under control to reduce the risk of heart disease
and related kidney damage.</SPAN></FONT></P>

Disease Warning Signs</B></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Although
there are no formal guidelines for screening for kidney disease in
people with rheumatoid arthritis, Gota said most rheumatologists
routinely monitor kidney health and function in people with RA
because some of the drugs used to treat it affect the kidneys.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Early
or moderate kidney disease often goes unnoticed because it rarely
causes symptoms. That&rsquo;s why regular kidney function tests are
needed to monitor it. Your doctor measures kidney function with the
glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The rate is calculated based on
your blood creatinine level, your age, your gender, and other
factors. </SPAN></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">As
kidney disease progresses, you may notice symptoms such as fatigue,
difficulty concentrating, trouble sleeping, muscle cramping, poor
appetite, nausea, abdominal pain or discomfort, and a change in the
volume of urine produced, according to the National Kidney
Foundation.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Other
risk factors for chronic kidney disease include diabetes, high blood
pressure, family history of kidney disease, advanced age, and being a
member of certain ethnic groups with higher rates of diabetes and
high blood pressure. Be sure your rheumatologist knows your family
history and about any other medical conditions you may have.</SPAN></FONT></P>
