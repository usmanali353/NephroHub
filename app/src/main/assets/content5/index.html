tips to prevent kidney disease</B></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Our
kidneys are designed such that their filtration capacity naturally
declines after the age of 30-40 years. With every decade after your
30s, your kidney function is going to reduce by 10%. But, if you&rsquo;re
going to increase the load on your kidneys right from the beginning,
your risk of developing </SPAN></FONT>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">To
be on the safe side, follow these few tips and take good care of your
kidneys to prevent the risk of developing kidney problems.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>1.
Manage diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease: </B>In most
of the cases, kidney disease is a secondary illness that results from
a primary disease or condition such as diabetes, </SPAN></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">heart
diseases or high blood pressure. Therefore, controlling sugar levels,
cholesterol and blood pressure by following a healthy diet, exercise
regimen and medication guidelines is essential to keep kidney disease
at bay.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>2.
Reduce the intake of salt:</B> Salt increases the amount of sodium in
diet. It not only increases blood pressure but also triggers the
formation of kidney stones.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>3.
Drink lots of water every day: </B> Water keeps you hydrated and
helps the kidneys to remove all the toxins from your body. It helps
the body to maintain blood volume and concentration. It also helps in
digestion and controls the body temperature. At least 8-10 glasses of
water a day is a must.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>4.
Don&rsquo;t resist the urge to urinate: </B></SPAN></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Filtration
of blood is a key function that your kidneys perform. When the
process of filtration is done, extra amount of wastes and water is
stored in the urinary bladder that needs to be excreted. Although
your bladder can only hold a lot of urine, the urge to urinate is
felt when the bladder is filled with 120-150 ml of urine. </SPAN></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">So,
if you start ignoring the urge to go to the restroom, the urinary
bladder stretches more than its capacity. This affects the filtration
process of the kidney.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>5.
Eat right: </B> Nearly all processes taking place inside your body
are affected by what you choose to eat and how you eat. If you eat
more unhealthy, junk and fast food, then your organs have to face the
consequences, including the kidneys. Do you know cauliflowers can
protect your kidneys?</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">You
should include right foods in your diet. Especially foods that can
strengthen your kidneys like fish, asparagus, cereals, garlic and
parsley. Fruits like watermelon, oranges and lemons are also good for
kidney health.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>6.
Drink healthy beverages: </B>Including fresh juices is another way of
drinking more fluids and keeping your kidneys healthy. Juices help
the digestive system to extract more water and flush out wastes from
the body. Avoid drinking coffee and tea. They contain caffeine which
reduces the amount of fluids in the body. So, the kidneys have to
work harder to get rid of them.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">If
you&rsquo;re already suffering from kidney problems, you should avoid
juices made from vegetables such as spinach and beets. These foods
are rich in oxalic acid and they help in the formation of kidney
stones. But you can definitely have coconut water. Read about </SPAN></FONT>

five health benefits of drinking coconut water</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>7.
Avoid alcohol and smoking:</B> Excess intake of alcohol can disturb
the electrolyte balance of the body and hormonal control that
influences the kidney function. Smoking is not directly related to
kidney problems but it reduces kidney function significantly. It also
has an adverse effect on heart health which can further worsen kidney
problems.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>8.
Exercise daily:</B> Researchers believe that obesity is closely
linked to kidney related problems. Being overweight doubles the
chances of developing kidney problems. Exercising, eating healthy and
controlling portion size can surely help you to lose extra weight and
enhance kidney health. Besides, you will always feel fresh and
active.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>9.
Avoid self medication:</B> All the medicines you take have to pass
through the kidney for filtration. Increased dosage or taking
medicines that you are not aware of can increase the toxin load on
your kidneys. That&rsquo;s why you should always follow dosage
recommendations and avoid self medication.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>10.
Think before you take supplements and herbal medicine: </B>If you&rsquo;re
on vitamin supplements or if you&rsquo;re taking some herbal
supplements, you should reconsider your dosage requirement. Excessive
amount of vitamins and certain plant extracts are linked to kidney
damage. You should talk to your doctor about the risk of kidney
disease before taking them.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">While
you are following these tips and trying to keep your kidneys healthy,
you should also be aware of various signs and symptoms that can
indicate a kidney problem. If you notice any of these symptoms of
kidney disease, you should consult a doctor immediately.</SPAN></FONT></P>
